# project_timeWatch
A fully functional **Stopwatch Timer** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, offering real-time control and time tracking. It also allows users to get current time/date and capture multiple time snapshots.
This project is a Stopwatch Timer Web Application created using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any external libraries or frameworks.

It contains complete front-end logic for starting, stopping, resetting a timer, capturing elapsed time, showing real-time clock, and displaying the current date. The project is great for learning DOM manipulation, timer functions, and UI event handling in JavaScript.

How It Works
When user clicks Start, timer begins counting every second

Stop pauses the count using clearInterval()

Reset sets count back to zero

Get Time logs the current count (e.g., "Time captured: 12 sec")

Clear Time removes all captured logs

Time button shows current real-time clock

Date button shows todayâ€™s full date and formats it nicely
